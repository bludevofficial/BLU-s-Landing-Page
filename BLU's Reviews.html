                <h2>Review Breakdowns</h2>
                <p>There are four main factors in my reviews:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Atmosphere: </strong>Any pests? Clean dishes and utensils? Noise level? How comfortable am I in this establishment?</li>
                        <li><strong>Price: </strong>Is the value of the experience worth what I'm being charged?</li>
                        <li><strong>Food: </strong>How's the presentation? How's the flavor? How hard would it be for me to make this myself?</li>
                        <li><strong>Service: </strong>This is the biggest thing that separates a restaurant from a home cooked meal. Do I feel like I'm having a better experience than if I were eating at home?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
